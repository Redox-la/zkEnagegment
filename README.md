# zkEngagement

**Privacy-Preserving Proof of Engagement, Powered by zkVerify**

---

##  Overview
**zkEngagement** is a proof-of-concept that demonstrates how to enable private, verifiable engagement on-chain — without revealing complete wallet histories or transaction details.

This standalone project is designed to showcase the potential of **zkVerify** as a modular verification layer.

---

##  What's Here (Right Now)
- `client/`, `server/`, `shared/`: your current project structure illustrating architecture
- `Web structure.md`: outlines project architecture and flow
- Basic frontend and backend boilerplate (TypeScript-based using Vite, Tailwind, Drizzle)

*(You might optionally demonstrate a UI screen or a stubbed flow here if helpful.)*

---

##  Missing Piece: zkVerify
While zkVerify isn't integrated *yet*, this project is structured to evolve into a full zk-powered system.  
**Next steps toward integration:**
- Implement zk proof logic in `server/`
- Connect with zkVerify’s Relayer for efficient proof validation
- Add UI flow in `client/` showing “Submit Proof” → “Verified”

---

##  Why This Matters
- **Reputation Without Exposure:** Users can prove “I engaged X times” without revealing their full history  
- **Private Incentives:** Unlock rewards or trust scores using verifiable engagement  
- **Cross-Chain Ready:** zkVerify enables proofs that work across multiple networks

##  Roadmap
| Milestone | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Phase 1 | Prototype zkEngagement flow (Proof staging & verification locally) |
| Phase 2 | Integrate zkVerify Relayer |
| Phase 3 | Build demo front-end experience |
| Phase 4 | Pilot use cases: private reputation, incentive unlocking, compliance proofs |
