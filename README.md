### 🔒 Privacy-Preserving Proof of Engagement, Powered by zkVerify  

---

## 🚀 Overview  
**zkEngagement** is a standalone project exploring **zero-knowledge proofs of engagement**.  
It enables users to prove participation, activity, or compliance **without revealing sensitive wallet or transaction data**.  

The project is designed to showcase how **zkVerify** can be integrated into real-world use cases that drive adoption.  

---

## 🔑 Problem  
In Web3 today, proving reputation or activity usually means exposing full wallet history.  
This lack of privacy creates barriers for users and limits broader adoption.  

---

## 💡 Solution — zkEngagement  
zkEngagement introduces private, verifiable proofs of engagement using **zkVerify**:  

- ✅ **On-Chain Reputation** → “This wallet engaged 10+ times” without exposing full activity  
- ✅ **Compliance-Friendly Proofs** → Show thresholds without revealing balances  
- ✅ **Private Rewards** → Unlock incentives with zero-knowledge proofs  
- ✅ **Cross-Chain Ready** → zkVerify enables lightweight, portable verification
